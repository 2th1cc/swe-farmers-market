## Technology Stack

The Farmers Market System is a specialized platform developed to improve the interaction between farmers and buyers, providing a streamlined experience for managing agricultural products. Each technology used in the system was carefully chosen to ensure efficiency, security, and ease of use.

For the user interface, we utilized Django's templating engine combined with standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This enabled us to design a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate interface tailored to user needs.

For the mobile stack, the system can be expanded using Flutter, a cross-platform framework known for its performance and flexibility. Flutter would allow the development of a single mobile application for both iOS and Android, maintaining a consistent user experience across devices.

On the backend, Django was selected as the primary framework due to its robust capabilities for handling complex operations. It simplifies tasks such as database interactions, user authentication, and API creation. To expose functionalities through APIs, Django REST Framework (DRF) was employed, which offers tools to build secure and efficient endpoints.

SQLite3 serves as the database for this project. Its lightweight nature and simplicity make it an excellent choice for the scale of this system. The database manages all essential entities, such as products, orders, users, and notifications, in a structured manner.

Additional functionality was incorporated using tools like Pillow, which enables image handling and optimization. Filtering and search functionalities were enhanced through Django Filters, allowing users to locate products or information quickly.

Together, this stack—Django for backend operations, SQLite3 for data storage, and standard frontend tools—creates a system designed to meet the needs of the farming community. The result is a reliable, functional platform that connects farmers and buyers effectively.

## Diagrams

To better understand how a system works and simplify further planning we have created four UML diagrams: Class, Component, Use Case and Activity  diagrams. These diagrams are presented below.
